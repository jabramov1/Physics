# Unicycle Game - README

## Overview

This is a simple physics-based game that demonstrates the properties of gravity and momentum. In this game, you control a unicyclist who must accelerate while going up a ramp to land in a target area without hitting spikes.

## How to Play

1. **Controls**: Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, and right) to control the unicyclist's movement.
2. **Acceleration**: To make it across ramps, use the arrow keys to accelerate appropriately by using momentum.
3. **Objective**: Your goal is to land in the target area without hitting any spikes. Avoid the spikes placed strategically in the game.
